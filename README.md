# Journal-Cli

**Journal-Cli** is a simple Bash script for journaling directly from your terminal. Create, view, edit, and delete daily entries quickly — all stored locally in `~/.config/journal-cli/entries/`. Built for personal use, but useful for anyone who prefers **fast, local, terminal-first journaling**.

## Features

* **Create new entries** with today’s date automatically.
* **View past entries** by selecting a date.
* **Edit entries** interactively using Vim.
* **Delete entries** easily by date.
* Fully terminal-based, lightweight, and requires no GUI or cloud services.

## Dependencies

* `vim`
* `figlet`, `lolcat` 

> ⚠️ Make sure these are installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository and make the script executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshitBanotra/Journal-Cli
cd Journal-Cli
chmod +x ./setup.sh

```
After this, simply run journal-cli in the terminal.
